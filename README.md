### Project Description: Movie and TV Show Recommendation System

In this project, I scraped the top 100 movies and TV shows from JustWatch using BeautifulSoup. The scraping process captured comprehensive details, including release dates, reviews, ratings, and more, which were then merged into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

Following the data collection, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and trends within the dataset. This analysis helped identify key features influencing viewer preferences.

I developed a content-based filtering model for movie recommendations, leveraging attributes such as genre, cast, and plot descriptions to suggest titles tailored to user preferences. 

I am seeking a review of this model to enhance its effectiveness and accuracy in providing personalized recommendations. Your feedback would be invaluable in refining the approach and improving user experience.
